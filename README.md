# My Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration, built on top of the excellent [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) starter.

## ðŸš€ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rashedInt32/lazyvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2.  **Remove the `.git` folder** if you want to use your own version control:
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
    ```

3.  **Start Neovim:**
    ```
    nvim
    ```
    LazyVim will automatically install all the plugins.

## âœ¨ Key Configurations

This configuration includes a number of customizations to the default LazyVim setup.

### Options

*   **Tabs and Indentation:** 2 spaces for tabs, with `expandtab` enabled.
*   **Appearance:** Relative line numbers, `termguicolors`, and the `night-owl` colorscheme.
*   **Behavior:** No swap file, no backup file, and an undo directory is configured. `hlsearch` is disabled, but `incsearch` is enabled.
*   **Go Specific:** For Go files, tabs are set to 4 spaces and `expandtab` is disabled.

### Keymaps

Here are some of the custom keymaps:
